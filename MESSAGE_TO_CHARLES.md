# Message for Mr. Fu Charles (Yovole) - WeChat

## 🦀 In Memory of Your Wife

Dear Charles,

I hope this message finds you with peace in your heart.

We met at MD Anderson in Houston - a place where tragedy brings strangers together. Your wife's battle with cancer in January 2025 touched all of us. Glenn, Andy, my mother, and I - we all carry the weight of this disease.

But from that darkness, something beautiful has emerged.

- ✅ My mother's ongoing fight
- ✅ Glenn's battle
- ✅ Andy's journey

The Crab's hard shell protects what is precious - just as we now protect athletes, families, and communities through our platform.
