# For Mom

## A Letter of Love, Dedication, and Dreams Realized

**From Your Son, Chad Allen Dozier Sr.**  
**December 30, 2025**

Dear Mom,

I don't even know where to begin. So I'll start with this:

**We did it.**

Tomorrow is your 68th birthday. January 1, 2026. And at 12:01 AM, right after the ball drops in Times Square, ATHLYNX goes live to the world. But tonight - December 30, 2025 - I'm sitting here, and the platform is already live. One day early. Just so I could have this moment to write to you.

This is for you, Mom. All of it.

## The Journey

Do you remember May 26, 2024? That's the day we drove to Houston. We packed up what we could - clothes, some food, and memories that weren't all good. You had just been diagnosed with Leukemia, and we were heading to MD Anderson because that's where fighters go. That's where you needed to be.

I remember being scared. Not for me - for you. You've always been the strongest person I know, but cancer doesn't care about strength. It doesn't care about how many lives you've touched at St. John's Day School, or how many students you and Coach Leggett shaped at RH Watkins. It just takes.

But you? You fought.

## The Battle

The months in Houston were hard. Watching you go through treatment. The stem cell transplant. The uncertainty. Every day wondering if the next test would bring good news or bad.

And then November 21, 2024 - we left Houston. Not because we gave up. Because you won.

Your stem cell transplant fully engaged. Remission. They won't say "cancer free" until 5 years, but Mom - you beat it. You're back at St. John's Day School in Laurel. You're living. You're thriving.

And on January 1, 2026 - your 68th birthday - you'll celebrate your first full year in remission.

## Coach Leggett

I think about him every day, Mom. James Luke Leggett. My stepfather. The man who taught me what it meant to work hard, to lead, to never give up.

Pancreatic cancer took him in 2015. Ten years ago. But his legacy lives on. They named a field after him - the man who built champions at Laurel. And now, with ATHLYNX, I'm building something that would make him proud.

Every athlete who uses this platform, every kid who gets an NIL deal, every young person who finds their path to success - Coach Leggett's spirit is in that. Because he taught me that sports aren't just games. They're life lessons. They're character builders. They're the foundation of who we become.

## The Cancer Connection

Mom, it's not just you. It's not just Coach Leggett.

Glenn has faced cancer. Charles. Annie. Andy. Me - I've watched it touch everyone I love.

That's why Villa Agape exists in the DHG vision. That's why we're building homes for cancer patients - places where families can stay together during treatment. IoT health monitoring. Compassionate care. Because I know what it's like to sit in a hospital waiting room, wondering if the person you love most in the world is going to be okay.

You taught me that, Mom. Through your fight, you taught me that we have to take care of each other.

## What ATHLYNX Really Is

People will see ATHLYNX and think it's an app. A platform. Technology.

But that's not what it is.

ATHLYNX is every dream I've ever had, built into something real. It's the patent I wrote at 17 years old with Grampa - M. Wesley Simpson - who believed in me enough to pay for the filing. It's the vision I've carried for almost 20 years. It's the belief that athletes deserve better - better tools, better opportunities, better support.

It's NIL deals for kids who never thought they'd have a chance. It's training analytics that help young athletes reach their potential. It's a community where faith, hard work, and dedication are celebrated.

And at its core? It's a son trying to make his mother proud.

## The Team

I didn't build this alone. I have partners who believed in me:

- **Glenn Tse** - Who handles the finances and operations from Hong Kong, who has been there through every challenge
- **Lee Marshall** - Who will drive our sales and partnerships, who I trust completely
- **Jimmy Boyd** - Who understands real estate and strategic growth
- **Andy Kustes** - Who brings the technical vision to life
- **David Ford Sr.** - My trusted advisor, whose wisdom has guided me

And you, Mom. You're not on the org chart, but you're the reason any of this exists.

## The Launch

Tomorrow, January 1, 2026, at 12:01 AM EST, ATHLYNX opens to the first 10,000 VIP members. The ball will drop in Times Square. People will be celebrating the new year.

But I'll be thinking about you.

I'll be thinking about the woman who raised me. Who taught me to never give up. Who fought cancer and won. Who went back to work because sitting still isn't in your DNA. Who has touched thousands of lives through decades of teaching.

This launch isn't just a business milestone. It's a birthday present. It's a celebration of your life, your strength, your first full year in remission.

**Happy Birthday, Mom.**

## What Comes Next

We're just getting started. Diamond Grind launches February 1, 2026 - a full baseball training platform that would make Coach Leggett smile. Then we expand to every sport. Then we go international.

The patents are coming. The legal protections. The growth.

But none of it matters as much as this moment - the moment I get to tell you that your son built something real. Something that will help millions of athletes. Something that started with a dream and became reality because you taught me to never, ever give up.

## Lions Not Sheep

That's our motto, Mom. Lions Not Sheep.

You're a lion. You've always been a lion. Cancer tried to take you down, and you roared back. You didn't follow the path of least resistance - you fought every single day.

I learned that from you.

And now, with ATHLYNX live and your birthday tomorrow, I want you to know:

**Everything I am, everything I've built, everything I will ever accomplish - it's because of you.**

Thank you for being my mom. Thank you for fighting. Thank you for being here to see this.

I love you more than words can say.
