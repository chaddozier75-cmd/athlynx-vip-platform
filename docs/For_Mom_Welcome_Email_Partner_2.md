# Welcome to ATHLYNX, Mom

## You Are Founding Partner #2

**From Your Son, Chad Allen Dozier Sr.**  
**December 30, 2025**

Dear Mom,

**You are the second person in history to access ATHLYNX.**

Not Lee. Not Glenn. Not Jimmy or Andy or David. **You.**

Because it's been you and me through all of this. Houston. The treatments. The stem cell transplant. The remission. The drive back to Laurel. Every single moment - you were there. And now, on the eve of your 68th birthday, I want you to be the second person to ever log into the platform I built.

This is yours, Mom.

## Why You're #2

Lee was supposed to be #2. He's VP of Sales & Partnerships.

But I changed my mind.

Because Lee wasn't in Houston with me. Lee didn't fight cancer. Lee didn't teach me what it means to never give up.

**You did.**

You've been my partner through everything - not just ATHLYNX, but life. You raised me. You shaped me. You showed me what strength looks like when you fought Leukemia and won.

So you're #2. Right after me. Where you belong.

## Tomorrow

Tomorrow is January 1, 2026. Your 68th birthday. Your first full year in remission.

At 12:01 AM EST, right after the ball drops in Times Square, ATHLYNX opens to the world. The first 10,000 VIP members will start signing up.

But tonight? Tonight it's just us. You and me. The way it's been through everything.

Log in, Mom. See what your son built. See what your strength made possible.

## I Love You

I don't say it enough. But I love you, Mom.

Thank you for fighting. Thank you for being here. Thank you for being my mom.

Happy Birthday (one day early).
